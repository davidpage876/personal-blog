                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the majority of my life I have been studying in one form or another. I have attended 3
                        different universities and 2 colleges. This isn’t to say I haven’t had my share of challenges.
                        Undiagnosed mental health issues had been one factor in my struggle to complete course work in
                        the past. I have had to learn ways to overcome these difficulties and thought it might be
                        helpful to document some of these.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Some Things Are Not Under Your Control</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes you can have all the motivation and drive to succeed, and yet be faced with obstacles
                        that you are powerless to control. It can be hard to accept the things one cannot change, while
                        not giving in to hopelessness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finding this balance is a part of the experience of living, but if I had to give some advice it
                        would be this: Be kind and fair towards yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favourite way of thinking about this is to imagine that you have a good friend that is going
                        through a very similar situation to you, with very similar struggles. Think about how you would
                        think of them. Would you call them lazy, or would you feel compassion towards them? Would you
                        motivate them to seek help and to do better with patient kindness, or would you abandon them
                        outright for their failures. I know which of those attitudes I would rather have towards myself,
                        and which would be most productive in making progress in my studies.
                    </p>

                    <a name="good-routines"></a>
                    <h2>Good Routines</h2>
                    <p>
                        With that out of the way, the most significant practical advice I have is to establish a clear
                        routine for study around your existing commitments. Ideally, study becomes something you do as
                        part of your normal routine, without having to think about or will yourself into doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you often need to consciously think about setting aside time to study that opens the door to
                        procrastination. On the other hand, if study becomes an automatic behaviour you will be
                        surprised how much you can accomplish and learn. Indeed, by being regularly engaged with your
                        study it will be difficult to fall behind, and easy to make course corrections when life gets in
                        the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I suggest making a schedule (digital or physical) to plan out your study routine. Think about
                        when you will be free to commit time to it and are likely to be able to follow through with that
                        commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, each weekday I get up a little bit earlier than usual so that I can do 30 minutes
                        to an hour of active study while eating breakfast before I head off to work. I know that after a
                        long day of work I won’t have any energy and am unlikely to want to study so I don’t allocate
                        time in the afternoon. However, I don’t mind watching some videos and doing a little bit of
                        reading in bed as I settle down to sleep, so I schedule 1 hour of passive study each night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I leave the weekend open in my schedule so that I can catch up on any missed study or do extra
                        work on assignments, however I aim for the weekend to be a break from study so that I can rest
                        and focus on other life commitments. It is important to have the opportunity to rest to avoid
                        burnout, again remembering to be kind to yourself as discussed above.

                    <h2>Active vs Passive Study</h2>
                    <p>
                        I find it helpful to distinguish between two modes of study: active and passive.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Active study involves “doing” things, such as writing, planning, practicing, working on
                            assignments, filling out quizzes or engaging in class discussions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Passive study involves “observing”, such as reading, listening to a lecture or podcast,
                            watching a video or browsing the web.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I generally find passive study to be easier to do when tired, and more comfortable, while active
                        study is more challenging. I do most of my active study in the morning when my mind is most
                        alert, while doing passive activities at night when I have less energy to commit to study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Doing passive study at night has the added benefit of helping to reinforce and consulate newly
                        learned material. It allows me to reflect on the challenges I faced during active study so that
                        I am better prepared to face them the next day after a good night’s sleep.
                    </p>

                <section class="post-section">
                    <a name="community"></a>
                    <h2>Student Community</h2>
                    <p>
                        I recommend surrounding yourself with fellow students who are as keen to succeed as you are.
                        These relationships can provide invaluable motivation to keep going, especially during stressful
                        times. It also gives you the opportunity to help and support other students, which is incredibly
                        fulfilling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A great first step to forming a connection with like-minded students is to be active in the
                        community. Just being present in discussions and class groups on regular basis is a good start.
                        Don’t be afraid to participate in discussions either. You may feel that you are not confident
                        enough to speak up or ask a question because you lack knowledge but remember that your
                        classmates are in the same situation (and may even have the same question). You are all still
                        learning, so it is natural to feel a little uncertain, but it is a very effective way to find
                        other students you can connect with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another great way to engage with other students is to try to help them with problems. There is
                        truth to the adage that teaching is the best way to learn. Even if you lack confidence in your
                        knowledge, there will almost certainly be something you have figured out in your studies (and
                        struggles) that someone else hasn’t. Helping another student can be highly rewarding by itself,
                        but it also helps you become more confident in the material yourself.

                    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        My final piece of advice is to practice “deep learning”. Deep learning involves tapping into
                        your innate curiosity to explore beyond the basic course material given. Rather than taking
                        material at face value, do your own investigations, asking why questions, rather than just how.
                        There may not be a satisfying answer, or one that is within your grasp at present, but the
                        effort of searching helps to build your knowledge at a deep level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can feel difficult to do this kind of activity when the core material is already challenging
                        by itself. It is true that deep learning is not easy in these times, but keep in mind that it
                        can help you get a better grasp of the core material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deep learning is a habit that must be practiced but can be highly rewarding. Not only does it
                        enhance your study outcomes, but it also means you will be better at your job in your future
                        career. Further, having the freedom to guide your own learning can be empowering and make
                        learning an intrinsically rewarding experience.
